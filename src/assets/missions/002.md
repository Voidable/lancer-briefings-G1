# Mission // #002
## Daybreak
# Goals
- Neutralize the enemy's comms jamming network. ✓
- Locate and secure Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee. ✓
  
# Parameters
- Intel places the nearest transmitter within a nearby financial/commercial district.
- There are reports that the Vestan Sovereignty has begun to deploy air assets.
- The existance of the jamming network also indicates that the Sovereignty forces have significant electronic warfare assets at their disposal.
  - Anticipate systemic invasion and localized sensor jamming/optical camouflage-equivalent capabilities.

# Stakes
- Failure to neutralize the enemy jamming network will incure heavy resistance on the LSA advance into Nov Elysia's central district.
- Failure to locate and secure Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee will likely result in capture or casualty by Sovereignty forces.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
