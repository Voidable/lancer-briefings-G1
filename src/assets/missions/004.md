# Mission // #004
## A Day Of Firsts
# Goals
- Insert into Vestan territory, link up with local resistance forces, gather additional supplies and equipment as necessary, and seize control of the suspected TARTARUS facility. 
    - Destruction of the facility has been approved if necessary. 
  
# Parameters
- The team is cleared to engage all hostile targets. Expect strong resistance while operating within enemy territory.
- Local Vestan defence patrols are noted to be highly mobile and aggressive: counter-mobility and anti-armor capabilities are strongly advised.

# Stakes
- Inability to assist resistance forces will severely diminish their effective capabilities. 
- The TARTARUS facility itself remains a mystery, but failure to take it quickly may result in the loss of valuable intelligence, hostages, and potentially even more serious consequences depending on the exact nature of TARTARUS itself.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
