*Misson Briefing - 1st Lt. Kim*

Attention everyone. Throughout the night we've been communicating with LSA command via courier, and we're going to be undertaking a joint operation today. Our objective remains the same, to locate and rescue the Ambassedor and the Captain.

To that end, we'll be assisting the LSA's push to retake Nov Elysia's central district. UNS-CV Teams will be deployed to shore up the LSA's shortcomings and to perform directed strikes on key Sovereignty assets in the area.
- Dagger and Hatchet Squadrons will be undertaking joint operations with LSA teams to flush out entrenched VS forces occupying choke-points along the city highways.
- Hammer Squadron will be hitting a VS motorcade.
- Arrow Squadron will be launching an attack on  the VS jamming infrastructure to bring it down.

We have limited ground teams and each of these objectives is vital to the LSA making adequate headway to retaking the city swiftly enough for us to secure Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee. Help the LSA, neutralize VS forces you encounter, bring our people home, and show them all what Union is capable of.

Detailed orders are routing to your teams, now head out there.
